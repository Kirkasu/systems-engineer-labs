# Lab 4 — Infrastructure Familiarity

**Goal:** Demonstrate understanding of cabling standards (TIA-568), IP surveillance segmentation, and monitoring considerations.

## Tasks
1. **Cabling Notes:** Summarize TIA-568A/B pinouts, copper categories, and fiber basics.
2. **Segmentation:** Propose VLANs: Surveillance, Control, Corp; inter-VLAN policy.
3. **Monitoring:** Outline sensors/metrics to monitor (latency, jitter, loss, storage).
4. **Stretch:** Research ruggedized/industrial switches/firewalls for harsh environments.

## Deliverables
- `diagrams/` — Logical layout
- `notes/` — Cabling/IP camera/NVR notes, assumptions
- `README.md` — Summary with risks and mitigations
