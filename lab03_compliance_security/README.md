# Lab 3 — Compliance & Security

**Goal:** Apply 10–15 CIS Benchmark-aligned recommendations to Windows Server; enable Defender and document before/after evidence.

## Tasks
1. **Baseline:** Capture OS and security state (e.g., key registry/policy settings).
2. **CIS Items:** Implement selected controls (account lockout, audit policies, firewall, RDP settings, SMB signing, etc.).
3. **Defender:** Ensure AV enabled, run quick/full scans, export results.
4. **Mapping:** Document each change and map to common control families (e.g., AC, AU, CM, SI).
5. **Stretch:** Draft an audit-readiness summary (who/what/when proofs).

## Deliverables
- `checklists/` — Items list with before/after
- `reports/` — PowerShell exports, Defender results
- `README.md` — Summary and mapping table

## Validation Checklist
- [ ] Each hardening item shows before/after evidence
- [ ] Defender scans complete with documented results
- [ ] Control mapping table included
